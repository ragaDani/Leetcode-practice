# Top Interview Questions

LeetCode(ing) is a fun exercise to learn competitive programming. The problems require important software engineering metrics(time complexity and space complexity) to arrive at the correct answer. The problems available are in three difficulties; <span style="color:green"> *Easy*</span>,<span style="color:orange"> *Medium*</span>, <span style="color:red"> *Hard*</span>. 
In this folder, I will be documenting my solutions to top interview questions on LeetCode. Please note that these solutions are here for learning/academic purposes only.
