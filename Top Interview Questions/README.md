# Top Interview Questions

LeetCode(ing) is a fun exercise to learn competitive programming. The problems require important software engineering metrics(time complexity and space complexity) to arrive at the correct answer. The problems available are in three difficulties; *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard*. 
In this folder, I will be documenting my solutions to top interview questions on LeetCode. Please note that these solutions are here for learning/academic purposes only. 

## File description

The following problems are my path to the destination of being a competitve programmer.

*   (*Easy*) Reserve a string: Requires us to reverse a string in place with O(1) extra memory. 
*   (*Hard*) Trapping rain water: Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute hor much water it is able to trap after raining.
